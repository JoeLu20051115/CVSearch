# MUSE

**Multi-Granularity Visual Search with Verification Feedback** is a training-free method for high-resolution visual question answering. MUSE combines whole-image prediction with local visual search and verification feedback. When more visual evidence is needed, it uses SAM 3 and SGAP to obtain informative image regions.

This repository contains the MUSE inference code, model adapters, prompts, and method documentation.

## Environment

- Python 3.11 or later
- PyTorch 2.7 with a CUDA build compatible with your NVIDIA driver (for GPU inference)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Create a Python environment and install the project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
